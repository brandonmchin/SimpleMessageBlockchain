# SimpleMessageBlockchain
A simple implementation of a blockchain for storing messages using Node.

Mining is only used as a mechanism for proof-of-work (there are no rewards as in many cryptocurrencies).

Be aware that the mining difficulty is set to 5 by default.  If you increase the difficulty, the process of mining a new block will take significantly longer.

## Usage
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
```
$ npm install
```
```
$ npm start
```
